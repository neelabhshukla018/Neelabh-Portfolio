---> Project Structure & File Linking This project follows a simple folder structure to organize files efficiently:


/project-root
│
├── index.html                  # Main HTML file
├── style.css                   # Main CSS stylesheet
├── images/                     # Folder containing images used in the site
│   ├── owner_img.jpg
│   ├── Project-1.png
│   ├── Project-2.png
│   ├── Project-3.png
│   └── Project-4.png
│
├── js/                         # Optional JavaScript files (if any)
│   └── script.js (if you add custom scripts)
│
└── other assets as needed



How Files Are Linked
The main HTML file (index.html) links the CSS file via:

CopyRun
<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
External libraries are included via CDN links in the <head> section:

CopyRun
<script src="https://kit.fontawesome.com/c44dbc2ee4.js" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/typed.js@2.0.12"></script>
Images are stored in the images/ folder and referenced like:




## Sections
